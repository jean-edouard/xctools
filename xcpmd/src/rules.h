#ifndef __RULES_H__

/**
 * The power management policy consists of a set of rules, and optionally variables as arguments to these rules.
 * A rule consists of an ID string, a set of conditions, a set of actions, and optionally a set of undo actions.
 * When all conditions are true, the rule becomes active, and the actions are executed in a set order.
 * When any condition becomes untrue, the rule becomes inactive, and its undo actions are executed in order.
 *
 * The set of condition types it is possible to trigger on are predefined as condition_type structs, which live in the
 * global list "condition_types". Condition_types are composed of a name, a "checker" function that returns a boolean,
 * a prototype string for the checker function, and a pointer to the event whose change triggers the evaluation of this
 * condition. The prototype is a simple list of space-separated characters; a map from characters to types is defined in
 * the arg_type enum. A C-style "pretty" prototype string is also included for self-documentation purposes.
 *
 * Conditions, which are structs instantiated from condition_types, belong to individual rules--each condition of each
 * rule is a unique object. A condition has a poiner to its rule, a pointer to the condition type it was instantiated from,
 * and a set of arguments to its checker function. A condition may also be inverted.
 *
 * Arguments are stored in arg_node structs that contain a union of possible types and an enum specifying the type.
 * Arguments of type string or var are assumed to contain malloc'd strings, which are free'd in undo functions.
 * Arguments of type var have a pointer to a db_var struct containing the cached DB value of that variable; more on
 * the variable cache is available in db-helper.c.
 *
 * Similarly to condition_types, there are also a set of action_types (stored in the global "action_types"). An
 * action_type has a name, a function returning void, a prototype for that function, and a pretty prototype for
 * documentation. Actions, which are unique for each rule, are instantiated from these action_types, and have a
 * pointer to their action_types and a set of arguments.
 *
 * The last main structure defined in this header is struct ev_wrapper, which is a thin wrapper around an input event, and
 * contains information necessary to the rule evaluation process. When an event of interest occurs, the corresponding
 * ev_wrapper's value field is modified, and handle_events() (which is defined in modules.c) is called with that ev_wrapper
 * as an argument. handle_events() checks all conditions that depend on that event (as defined in struct member listeners),
 * and if a condition has changed, evaluates the rule that contains that condition.
 *
 * At initialization, an ev_wrapper is given a name, a type, and a reset value (which is also used as an initial value), and
 * it is defined as stateful or stateless. There is some wiggle room with what events are inherently stateful or stateless,
 * but the most important difference is that stateless events have their values reset to their reset_values automatically
 * before exiting handle_events(). An example of a stateless event is a button push, where a keystroke event sets the
 * value to true for only an instant. Stateful events may be more appropriate for things like whether the lid is open or
 * closed, or the current battery percentage of the system.
 *
 * An ev_wrapper may have many conditions depending on it, but each condition may depend on only one ev_wrapper.
 *
 * A list of all ev_wrappers currently tracked is maintained in the global variable events. A module that registers
 * condition_types should also register the ev_wrappers that those condition_types depend on.
 *
 * Many of the data structures here rely on a linked list very close to that of the Linux kernel's. It is doubly-linked
 * and circular, and the heads of lists are empty.
